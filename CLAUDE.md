# Muse — Claude project notes

This file is loaded into Claude's context when working in this repo.
It documents the project's identity, current state, and conventions
so a fresh Claude session can pick up productively.

## Project identity

Muse is a **filesystem-native universal file viewer + AI-organized
asset library** for macOS, in the spirit of Adobe Bridge but
local-first, Apple-Intelligence-native, and free forever.

- Distribution: **Direct** — a Developer ID–signed, notarized build that
  self-updates via **Sparkle**, hosted on GitHub Releases (DMG with a
  drag-to-Applications background). **Not the Mac App Store**: Sparkle
  self-update is incompatible with MAS, and shipping directly lets updates
  go out without an App Store submission. Still **sandboxed**. (Pivoted from
  MAS on 2026-06-15 — see that session log. If a MAS build is ever wanted,
  it must be a separate target/config with Sparkle compiled out.) Release
  workflow: `docs/RELEASING.md`.
- Pricing: **Free**, no IAPs, no subscriptions, no ads
- Network policy: **Update-only, plus one explicit opt-in publish path.** No
  analytics, no telemetry, no data collection, no remote content fetches. Two
  sanctioned network code paths, both gated by `com.apple.security.network.client`:
  (1) **Sparkle** — fetching its signed appcast feed + downloading the update;
  (2) **Google Drive collection share** (`feat/drive-collection-share`,
  2026-06-25) — when the user signs into Google and presses Publish, the
  selected images + form text upload to **the user's own Drive** (OAuth
  `drive.file`, PKCE). This is opt-in + user-initiated; the developer still
  receives no data (bytes go user → their Drive). Every Sparkle download is
  EdDSA-verified against the embedded `SUPublicEDKey`. `SUEnableAutomaticChecks = true` so Sparkle checks
  quietly in the background with no UI unless an update exists (the first-run
  consent prompt was removed 2026-06-15 — it was a confusing first launch and
  its modal stole focus from the main window).
  iCloud Drive *document* sync (the optional single "Muse" iCloud folder) is
  mediated by the OS sync daemon and adds only the iCloud Documents
  entitlement. The developer still receives **no data**, so the "Data Not
  Collected" privacy label is unchanged.
- Data collection: **None**. Privacy nutrition label = "Data Not Collected".
- Min macOS: **14.6** (Vision/PDFKit/AVKit/FSEvents/FTS5 all work).
  Foundation Models is used only to name auto-generated collections,
  capability-gated to Apple Intelligence Macs (macOS 26+); the in-app
  chat panel was retired (see the 2026-06-12 session log).
- Primary user persona: **generalist** — managing a Downloads folder,
  Documents, miscellaneous archives. Defaults bend to fast Quick Look
  + Open With; AI features available but not the front door.

## Plan documents

The full design lives in:

- `docs/superpowers/plans/file-viewer-rewrite.md` — the binding plan.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-10-post-rewrite-polish-design.md` — the
  polish-pass spec (all four phases shipped: AI brain ✅, hero viewer ✅,
  spatial views ✅, delights ✅).
  Five rounds of review revisions baked in. All open product questions
  resolved. Implementation status reflected in the phase log below.

Read this before making any non-trivial change. The identity
reconciliation matrix in §4 and the FileNode lifecycle table in §3.1
are the load-bearing reference artifacts.

- `docs/possible-updates.md` — low-priority, non-blocking backlog (cosmetic
  code tidiness + deferred decisions). Nothing here is a problem; fold items in
  opportunistically when shipping something else. Don't cut a release for them.
- `docs/search-bar-fill-investigation.md` — **deferred.** Why the center search
  field can't be made to fill the toolbar Safari-style within SwiftUI, every
  approach tried (`.infinity`, width-tracking, `.searchable`) and why each
  failed, and what a real fix (native `NSToolbar` rebuild) would cost. Read it
  before re-attempting "make the search bar fill the space" so the dead ends
  aren't repeated.

| Polish 16 — accessibility pass on features added since `feat/next-17` (next-18→24): VoiceOver labels/traits, a menu-bar "New Collection from Selection…" command, an icon-only-button label sweep across the whole app, and a `CollectionCard` rework (one activatable element w/ name+count label, selected trait, primary + named-Delete actions) | ✅ shipped | `feat/next-25` |
| Polish 17 — iCloud collection share (backend #1 of a two-backend "share a collection") | ❌ **REMOVED 2026-06-25** | `feat/icloud-collection-share` (merged, then ripped out) |
| → *Why removed:* the whole design rested on the false assumption that `NSSharingServicePicker(items:[folder])` would offer a "Copy Link" service for a folder in the app's iCloud container. **It never does** — the iCloud Drive public-link affordance is Finder-only, not a programmatic `NSSharingService`. So the share sheet only offered file-transfer services; emailing the raw images got bounced by Gmail. Apple exposes no API to mint a public iCloud gallery link. **The Drive backend (Polish 18) is the real link path** — keep that; do NOT re-add an in-app iCloud "Share Link". | | |
| Polish 18 — Google Drive collection share (backend #2, the "magic" path): "Share Drive Link" → OAuth `drive.file`/PKCE sign-in → upload images into a tidy `My Drive/Muse/<collection> — <date>/` → link-share → branded Cloudflare page (`muse-share.pages.dev`; manifest in the URL fragment, images from Drive thumbnails, backdrop switcher light/grey/dark). **PDF = the recipient prints the page** (`window.print()` + print stylesheet, they pick the paper size) — NO app-side PDF generated/uploaded. View-menu "Manage Drive Shares…" (open link / unpublish). Muse-local expiry sweep deletes the folder past its date. **First sanctioned network egress beyond Sparkle** — opt-in, user-initiated. The Drive UI is **NOT** `#if DEBUG`-gated — "Share Drive Link" (`ShareCollectionButton`), the Settings sign-in row, and "Manage Drive Shares…" ship in **release** builds. **OAuth consent screen must be flipped to "In production" in Google Cloud Console** for non-test users to publish — while it's in "Testing" status, only manually-added test users can sign in (everyone else hits Google's "app is being tested" wall) and refresh tokens expire after 7 days. `drive.file` is non-sensitive → production needs NO verification review / CASA audit, only a complete consent screen (homepage + **published privacy policy URL**, served from `web/share/privacy.html`). Privacy + Terms live at `web/share/{privacy,terms}.html` (Cloudflare clean URLs `/privacy` `/terms`), linked from the share-page footer. Pure units (PKCE/manifest/store/expiry/multipart) + JS tests. | ✅ merged | `feat/drive-collection-share` |

> **2026-06-16 session — three feature branches off `main`, not yet merged.**
> Each has its own spec + plan in `docs/superpowers/`. Merge order is
> independent; reconcile `docs/session-log.md` + this file's architecture map on merge.

`feat/file-viewer-rewrite` was merged to `main` after Phase 8
finished — see the merge commit. The branch was kept around as an
audit trail of the per-phase progression.

## Session history

The full, chronological narrative of every working session (2026-06-12 →
present) lives in **`docs/session-log.md`** — read the relevant entry when you
need the full "why" behind a specific change. The load-bearing decisions and
must-not-break rules from those sessions are distilled below so a fresh session
doesn't have to read the whole archive.

### Durable constraints & gotchas (DO NOT BREAK)

Hard-won — re-introducing any of these re-introduces a shipped bug. The four
most critical are also Claude memories (linked). Full repro/why is in
`docs/session-log.md` under the cited branch.

- **Grid must stay virtualized.** No custom SwiftUI `Layout` or non-lazy container over the full file set — it materializes every tile + relayouts O(n) per publish (1700-image folders died). Use `MasonryGeometry` frames + a manual viewport window. Memory: `muse-grid-must-stay-virtualized`.
- **Fix the code, not the dev DB.** The user's library is a disposable fixture; never ship one-off migrations to patch a corrupted local DB — fix forward code, validate by clean re-index. Memory: `muse-fix-code-not-my-data`.
- **iCloud change detection = content hash, NOT size/mtime.** iCloud oscillates size/mtime on repeated reads, so a size/mtime fast-path reindexes the whole folder every visit. In-place edits are re-checked via content hashing (FSEvents live + cold-open verify) — deliberate. The zero-byte-hash guard in `HashService.sha256` must stay (its loss welded 900+ files onto one row). Memory: `muse-icloud-content-refresh-override`.
- **Classification never reads dataless iCloud bytes.** `AssetKind`'s ImageIO header sniff (extensionless-image fallback) guards on `.ubiquitousItemDownloadingStatusKey` and skips not-downloaded placeholders — reading bytes would force a download to classify a file the user is just browsing. Reclassifies once local. Same spirit as `Indexer.isDataless` / `HashService` dataless-nil.
- **Tags are per `(file_id, parent_dir)`**, not per content hash. A duplicate in another folder has its own tags; deletes never leak across folders; NO library-wide tag delete. Other content-derived metadata (palette/caption/dims/intent/feature-print/FTS) stays content-hash-keyed. Memory: `muse-tags-are-per-file-not-per-content-hash`.
- **A shared `files` row must SPLIT on edit-in-place, never be rewritten.** Two byte-identical files in different folders dedupe onto one `content_hash`-UNIQUE row. `Indexer.reconcile`'s edit-in-place branch only rewrites the row in place when it's the SOLE alive path; when >1 alive path shares it, it splits (new row for the edited path, carrying that location's tags AND its manual collection memberships) so the untouched sibling isn't corrupted and the two copies don't ping-pong the shared hash. Don't collapse the split branch back into an unconditional in-place update (`IndexerReconcileTests` guards both directions + the membership carry).
- **iCloud container is data-loss-sensitive.** Debug builds sign with `*-Debug.entitlements` (production minus the three iCloud keys) so dev churn can't make `bird` purge the production ubiquity container. Ship updates via **Sparkle only** (atomic in-place swap preserves identity) — never tell users to drag a new DMG over the old app.
- **No live SQLite in iCloud** (corruption trap) — sync is per-asset JSON sidecars via `NSFileCoordinator`. CloudKit rejected (adds a network surface; the network paths are Sparkle + the opt-in Drive publish).
- **iCloud collection share was REMOVED (2026-06-25) — do NOT re-add it.** The "Share iCloud Link" backend (per-collection copy into `Documents/Shared Collections/`, `NSMetadataQuery` upload wait, "Manage iCloud Shares…") was ripped out because it could not deliver a link: `NSSharingServicePicker` does not offer iCloud's "Copy Link" service for app-container files (that affordance is Finder-only, with no programmatic API), so the share sheet only attached the raw images and email bounced. The deleted units (`ICloudSharePaths`/`ICloudShareStore`/`UploadTally` + the folder-name-safety guards) are gone with it. **The Drive backend (Polish 18) is the only sanctioned collection-link path** — it has a real API. `ICloudZone` stays (it serves iCloud *sync*, a separate feature).
- **Google Drive share security invariants (DO NOT relax).** Scope is EXACTLY `drive.file` (Muse touches only files it created — never broaden to `drive`/`drive.readonly`; that triggers the CASA audit too). OAuth is **Authorization Code + PKCE S256, NO client secret** in the app; tokens live ONLY in Keychain (`…AfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`, never UserDefaults/logs/synced); sign-out revokes. The share page is a static file with **no API key and no secret** — the manifest rides the URL **fragment** (`#…`, never sent to the host), rendered via `textContent` only with id-regex validation under a `default-src 'none'` CSP. Network happens ONLY inside an explicit user action (sign-in/Publish/Manage/expiry-sweep). **Every uploaded image is metadata-stripped first (`ImageMetadataStripper`, called in `DriveClient.uploadFile`) — GPS/EXIF/camera/IPTC/XMP/maker-notes all removed, ONLY display orientation kept.** The original is reachable by recipients (the file is anyone-readable AND its id is in the public share URL — the on-page Google thumbnail is EXIF-free but the original isn't), so stripping is a privacy requirement, NOT optional. It's **fail-closed**: a file that can't be decoded throws and aborts the publish rather than upload an un-stripped original; non-writable types (RAW) fall back to a re-encoded bare JPEG. Don't remove the strip or weaken it to GPS-only. Expiry is **Muse-local** (launch sweep deletes the Drive folder it created). The recipient's PDF is the **printed page** (`window.print()`), no app-side PDF. Files live in `Sharing/Drive/`; the page in `web/share/` (deployed to `muse-share.pages.dev`). **Sign-in/out is a Settings row** (`SettingsView` "Google Drive" section); `prompt=select_account` lets a user switch accounts. **Account-switch leaves the OLD account's share folders orphaned (by design, NOT a bug):** `drive.file` is account-scoped, so once signed into a new account Muse can't see/delete the old account's folders — the expiry sweep + manual delete treat the resulting 404 as success and just drop the local record (the page still soft-expires). To truly clean up, delete shares via Manage Drive Shares BEFORE signing out. `signOut()` clears `driveRootFolderID` so the new account gets a fresh root.
- **Share manifest may be DEFLATE-compressed + carries per-image filenames — decode MUST cap the inflate (zip-bomb guard).** The fragment now encodes either raw JSON or `[0x01 marker][raw-DEFLATE(JSON)]` (the app picks whichever is shorter, so filenames — key `f`, 1:1 with image ids — don't bloat the link). Raw DEFLATE = Swift `COMPRESSION_ZLIB` ⇄ vendored **fflate** `inflateSync` (`web/share/fflate.module.js`, MIT, pure-compute/no-network — keep it that way; legacy uncompressed links `{`-first still decode). The fragment is unsigned + attacker-suppliable, so `decodeManifest` inflates into a **bounded** `MAX_INFLATED` buffer — a decompression bomb truncates to garbage → `null`, never an unbounded allocation. Don't remove the cap, don't broaden the CSP for fflate (it's a `'self'` ES-module import), and `f` must stay length-matched to `g` (mismatch → captions dropped, not mis-paired). All attacker-supplied display text (filenames + signature) renders via `textContent` AND through `sanitizeText` (strips bidi-override/zero-width/control chars — anti-spoofing) with per-field length caps; ids are upper-bounded (`{20,200}`). Grid tiles are `<button>`s (keyboard-operable → lightbox), and the caption uses the AA-contrast `--caption` token (not `--muted`). Don't relax these.
- **Edit-menu "Select All" is the STANDARD item, driven by `AppDelegate.selectAll(_:)` — don't add a custom one.** SwiftUI auto-generates a standard `Select All ⌘A` whose `selectAll:` routes through the AppKit responder chain; the SwiftUI grid is no responder, so the app's lone `NSApplicationDelegate` (`@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`, the terminal chain link) implements `selectAll(_:)` → `appState.selectAllVisible()` + `validateMenuItem` (enabled on non-empty `visibleFiles`). A focused search field's field editor still wins ⌘A for its text (it's higher in the chain). A second, custom `Button("Select All")` produced a confusing duplicate (one greyed system item + one working custom) — that's what this replaced; never re-add it, and don't delete the `AppDelegate` (it also returns `applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState = true`). "Deselect All" (⇧⌘A) stays bespoke (no system equivalent).
- **Sidebar rows: never use `.onDrag`.** It installs an AppKit drag source on the shared hosting view and eats single-clicks. Reorder is a live `DragGesture` off a trailing grip + an opaque on-top overlay (both folder + collection lists).
- **`bookmarks.$roots` sink delivers synchronously** — don't add `.receive(on:)`; the non-animated reorder commit relies on synchronous delivery.
- **Fixed-viewport overlay effects:** per-element `.layerEffect`/`.visualEffect` is the wrong tool (breaks containers, only on-screen elements). The gradual-blur attempt was fully reverted.
- **No Metal shaders remain** (water + burn removed); `Effects/` holds only the opacity-fade delete modifier.
- **FSEvents:** the stream needs `kFSEventStreamCreateFlagUseCFTypes` or `eventPaths` is a raw `char**` (crash on first change).
- **The SVG viewer's no-network guard is a `WKContentRuleList`, NOT the nav delegate.** `WKNavigationDelegate.decidePolicyFor` fires ONLY for frame navigations, never subresources — so an attacker-supplied `.svg` with `<image href="https://…">` / `<use href>` / `<feImage>` / CSS `url()`/`@import`/`@font-face` leaked the viewer's IP on mere preview (a real shipped privacy bug — JS-off does NOT stop these passive loads). Fix lives in `SVGViewerView`: a content rule blocks `https?://`, `wss?://`, and host-bearing `file://[^/]` (the protocol-relative `//host` trick) at the *resource* layer; the file load is **deferred until the rule installs** and **fails closed** (don't render) if it can't. Don't "simplify" this back to nav-delegate-only or load before the rule — verified live (a remote `<image>` egress beacon stays unhit while the SVG still renders).
- **Hero close:** the slight search-bar "flash" on close (native toolbar materializing over the fading backdrop) is inherent + accepted. Do NOT reintroduce the always-present-toolbar or return-after-land approaches (both tried). **Escape must fire ONLY `viewerClosing = true`** and let `startClose()` own the whole close (incl. setting `viewerDismissing`), exactly as the X button does — a separate `viewerDismissing` write in the Escape path made Escape need TWO presses.
- **Collection "delete" = `setHidden(true)`** (durable tombstone the recluster never clears), NOT a row delete (silently regenerates).
- **Bulk tag delete leaves `analyzed_hash` untouched** so the auto-tagger never resurrects removed tags; they return only via explicit Regenerate.
- **Bulk tag ops (Delete All Tags / Regenerate) scope to `tagSourceFiles`, NOT `currentFiles`.** `currentFiles` is the underlying FOLDER even while a collection is on screen (the grid renders `activeCollectionFiles`), so using it makes "Delete All Tags" hit the folder, not the collection the user is viewing — the same wrong-target class as single-tag delete (which already uses `tagSourceFiles`). The bulk dialogs say "in this view" (not "this folder") for the same reason — they're reachable inside collections.
- **Duplicates modal never fully deletes a group** — ≥1 copy always kept. A file can be in several groups (byte-exact + filename + visual), so `DuplicateDeleteRules` checks EVERY group it belongs to, not just the first: emptying a group is refused (3+) or swaps (2-copy); cross-group pre-seed conflicts reconciled by `rescued`. Don't reintroduce a per-first-group check.
- **Never drive a perpetual animation with a global `withAnimation(.repeatForever)` in `.onAppear`.** The transaction stays live and leaks into ANY view repositioned in the same update cycle (most visibly the AppKit toolbar — `GridView`'s `ShimmerBand` drifted the toolbar icons). Use value-scoped `.animation(_:value:)` to confine the repeat to its subtree.
- **A `ScrollView` clips to its OWN frame — reserve floating-toolbar clearance ABOVE the scroll view, not as inner padding.** The toolbar background is hidden, so any scroll surface reaching the toolbar edge slides content under it. Inner `.padding(.top:)` scrolls away with content. Every top-level scroll surface (grid AND `CollectionsPage`) needs its own reserve, kept on the shared `TagChipsRow.noTagsTopClearance` constant.
- **Sidebar live-drag reorder must commit the new order SYNCHRONOUSLY, and the reorderable list must be a NON-lazy stack.** (1) The commit clears lift offsets in a `withTransaction(disablesAnimations)` block that ASSUMES the list is already reordered — so the reorder must land in that same synchronous transaction (folders get it free via `$roots`; collections update `CollectionsEngine.collections` sort_order in place synchronously, then persist async). (2) A reorderable `ForEach` must be a plain `VStack` by stable id, NOT `LazyVStack` over `Array(enumerated())` (which makes a reorder read as insert/remove and fly rows in). Animate with a list-scoped `.animation(_:value:)`.
- **`withAnimation` does NOT animate an `@AppStorage`-backed change** — the UserDefaults publish lands outside the transaction (instant). To animate a persisted bool, back it with plain `@State` seeded from/written to `UserDefaults` via `.onChange`, or use value-scoped `.animation(_:value:)`.
- **Never bind a `TextField` (or any per-keystroke control) directly to a `@Published` property on the monolithic `AppState`.** Each keystroke fires `AppState.objectWillChange`, re-evaluating the WHOLE `ContentView` body (sidebar + tag chips + grid) — fast Macs hide it, but on slower Macs typing visibly lags. Hold the draft in LOCAL `@State` inside a small dedicated `ViewModifier`/subview and write to `AppState` only on commit (the alert's Create/Rename button). The dialog alerts do this via `NameCollectionAlert` / `FolderNameAlerts` (seed local `@State` on open with `.onChange`; folder drafts key on the request's `id` since `FolderNode` isn't `Equatable`, and closing always passes through nil so re-targeting the same folder re-seeds).
- **`AnalyzePipeline` passes serialize through `acquirePass()`, NOT a bare `while isRunning` busy-wait.** A sleep-gate wakes all waiters at once → two passes run + `cancelActivePass()` halts the wrong one. The fix: a synchronous `passClaimed` flag claimed with NO `await` between check and set (only the first woken waiter takes it); the claiming wrapper holds it via `defer` for its whole body. `analyze(folder:)`/`analyze(file:)` must NOT consult `passClaimed` (deadlock); cancel returns BEFORE the claim. **Every direct entry point that starts a pass must hold the claim:** the automatic paths go through `analyzePending`/`regenerateTagless`, and the manual menu/App-Intent paths go through `analyzeFolderManual`/`analyzeFileManual` — calling bare `analyze(folder:)`/`analyze(file:)` from a non-claiming caller lets a manual pass run concurrently with the automatic one (the exact bug the gate prevents).
- **Folder/scope path-prefix checks need a trailing `+ "/"`.** A bare `hasPrefix` matches a sibling (`/a/Inspo` ⊂ `/a/Inspo Extra/x.jpg`). Every prefix test guards with `$0 == prefix || $0.hasPrefix(prefix + "/")` (`Housekeeping`, `CollectionStore.isUnderAnyRoot`, `ICloudZone`, `PathReconciler`, `FolderRenameMigration`, `SearchService`). Use the same rule for any new containment check.
- **`BookmarkStore.addRoot` must `activate(root)` BEFORE `roots.append(root)`.** Appending publishes `$roots`, whose sink rebuilds the sidebar synchronously; `rebuildRootNodes` drops any root whose `url(for:)` is nil, and that reads `accessedURLs` (populated only by `activate`). Activate-after-append silently drops the new root's node (last-added vanishes). Don't reorder back.
- **A trailing debounce with NO maxWait cap starves forever under a sustained event stream.** `FolderStatCache` rescheduled its 0.4s recompute on EVERY FSEvents under a root, so iCloud sync churn froze the sidebar count indefinitely. Fix: a 2.0s maxWait cap (pure `StatRecomputeScheduler`) — past the cap, flush immediately instead of rescheduling. Any debounce over an unbounded event source needs this.
- **Renaming a ROOT folder needs a one-time parent-access grant — the sandbox can't write a root's parent directory.** A security-scoped bookmark grants a folder's *contents*, not the right to rename the folder itself (renaming writes to its PARENT). So an in-place `FileManager.moveItem` of a top-level (sidebar) folder fails with a real permission error (`parent writable: false`). `FolderOps.rename` distinguishes this (`.parentNotWritable`) from a genuine `.ioError`; `renameFolder` responds by calling `BookmarkStore.grantParentAccess(forRenaming:)` (an `NSOpenPanel` pointed at the parent — "Grant Access" returns the shown dir), then retries the move under that transient powerbox scope and repoints the root bookmark. The parent grant is NOT persisted (Muse's library is the folder, not its parent). Subfolders (parent already in scope) never see the picker. Don't collapse `.parentNotWritable` back into a blind "you may not have permission" message — that hid the real cause and made it undebuggable. In one-level browse, `visibleFiles` contains `.folder` `FileNode`s, so a co-selected folder rides along in any flow built on `effectiveSelectionURLs`. Move-to-Trash + sidebar drop-to-move both skip folders (`kind != .folder`); `SelectionActionsMenu` filters via `fileURLs`. Folder ops live ONLY on the folder card's context menu. Any new selection action must decide explicitly whether it applies to folders (default for file-only/destructive: exclude).
- **Any input that NARROWS `visibleFiles` must clear or prune the selection.** The selection `Set<String>` is independent of `visibleFiles`, and `effectiveSelectionURLs` rebuilds a URL for an off-view selected file (so a hidden file rides into Move/Collection/Tag/Share). Active-tag + collection-removal + collection-scope + folder-select + **search (`runSearch`, after the stale-token guard)** + **`toggleSubfolders`** (only on the OFF/narrowing direction — turning subfolders ON merely widens, so the selection stays valid) + **`removeRoot`** + the **burn-delete `onRemove`** (drops the trashed path from `selectedFiles`) call `clearSelection()`/prune; `gridFilter.didSet` calls `pruneSelectionToVisible()`. A new filter/scope that can hide selected tiles must prune in lockstep. (Entering search, subfolder-toggle, root-removal, and burn-delete each historically skipped this — fixed in the post-1.3.3 + whole-codebase review passes.)
- **App Intents must NOT read `currentFiles` right after `openFromIntent` — enumerate the folder URL directly.** `openFromIntent → select(folder:)` clears `currentFiles` and re-enumerates OFF-MAIN, so a value read in the same turn is empty. The duplicate/analyze intents go through `AppState.analyzableURLs(at:)` (enumerates the folder itself); don't "simplify" them back to reading the grid's `currentFiles` (they'd silently operate on nothing).
- **An explicit `.foregroundStyle` overrides SwiftUI's automatic disabled dimming.** `View.moodToolbarIcon` colors glyphs explicitly from the mood, so a `.disabled` control's icon stayed full color. Fix: `moodToolbarIcon` is a `ViewModifier` reading `@Environment(\.isEnabled)` and applying `.opacity(isEnabled ? 1 : 0.4)`. Don't pair a fresh explicit `foregroundStyle` with `.disabled` expecting auto-dimming.
- **A `LazyVStack` row list inside a shared `ScrollView` can de-materialize and not come back — use a plain `VStack` for short sidebar lists.** The FOLDERS section's `LazyVStack` could drop off-screen rows on scroll and leave the section empty (not data loss — `rootNodes` intact). `folderList` is now a plain `VStack` by node id, like `collectionsList`. Short lists sharing a `ScrollView` gain nothing from laziness and risk the vanishing-rows glitch.
- **The tag chip filter is an ORDERED SET, not a scalar — `activeTagPaths` is the INTERSECTION (AND).** `activeTagLabels: [String]` (insertion order drives the banner). Mutate ONLY via `setActiveTags` (core — clears selection, recomputes `activeTagPaths` as the intersection) / `setActiveTag` / `toggleActiveTag`. **`setActiveTags` resolves the WHOLE filter SYNCHRONOUSLY** — it commits `activeTagLabels` AND reads each tag's paths (`pathsForTagSync`, a sync main-thread DB read) to set `activeTagPaths`, all in the click's own runloop turn, so the filter bar and the grid swap land in ONE render. A token-guarded async Task (the old design) committed the labels a frame BEFORE the paths, so the just-appeared bar shoved the still-unfiltered grid DOWN before the query returned — the "slide down, then replace" jag. The sync read can only ever wait behind one per-file write on the serial queue (a few ms; there are NO bulk write transactions to block on), and serial resolution also kills the old fast-Cmd-click stale-read race. Each per-label query stays `parent_dir`-scoped. `singleActiveTag` (count==1?first:nil) gates the single-tag menu commands. Empty intersection is a legitimate empty grid (only the single-tag case falls back to "All"). Chips + filter also mount/apply during SEARCH (search-aware `tagSourceFiles`/`reloadTagChips`). `EscapeResolver` `.clearTags` is ordered after search, before collection back-out. **The active-filter bar (`TagChipsRow`, below the chips) MUST render straight from `activeTagLabels` and show for 1+ tags — NOT gated on the scope's chips or a 2+ threshold.** Tags carry over into collections, so a single tag, or tags ORPHANED into a collection with none of them, would otherwise leave an empty grid with no on-screen sign a filter is active and no way to clear it (owner-reported bug). Each pill's ✕ removes one (`setActiveTags(TagSelection.removing(…))`); Clear all = `setActiveTag(nil)`. Don't re-add a visibility threshold or scope the bar to in-scope chips.
- **The grid's wholesale-swap `.id` must key on the RESOLVED filter (`tagFilterGeneration`), NOT `activeTagLabels`.** `activeTagPaths.didSet` bumps `tagFilterGeneration` in lockstep with the resolved set; the grid keys on that. (Historically labels and `activeTagPaths` landed in different frames — paths via an async query — so keying the `.id` on labels rebuilt the canvas early and flashed the PRIOR tag's files until the query returned, the switch flicker. `setActiveTags` now resolves synchronously so both land in one frame, but keying on the resolved generation is retained as the correct, gap-proof rule.) And the swap is **`.transition(.identity)`, not `.opacity`** — outgoing/incoming canvas read the same global `visibleFiles`, so a symmetric opacity fade dims two identical layers to ~75% and back (a visible blip, not a real cross-fade — shared state can't give one without snapshotting). `.identity` is required (an `.id` change inside `withAnimation` defaults to `.opacity`); don't "simplify" it away. Tag/collection switches are now an instant replace by design. **Folder switches follow the same rule:** the fresh-select reveal in `reloadCurrentFiles` (the `freshSelect` branch) commits `tagChipRows`/`tagRowReady` WITHOUT `withAnimation` so the new folder hard-cuts in (tab-switch feel), not fade in — don't re-wrap it; the fade was a perceived "lag after click." Files + chips still commit in one `MainActor` transaction so the "images appear already in place below the chips" ordering is preserved.
- **Don't put an AppKit `NSViewRepresentable` inside a SwiftUI `.popover` whose CONTENT SIZE changes at runtime.** The grid filter's tri-state "Images" `NSButton` paired with an expand/collapse disclosure left a stale blurred layer snapshot (ghosting) — the AppKit subview blocks the hosting view's size invalidation. Fix: fixed-size popover (show all format checkboxes always). Keep such popovers fixed-size, or use pure SwiftUI for the dynamic part.
- **A mouse-only modifier interaction has NO VoiceOver equivalent — give it a parallel named `.accessibilityAction`.** VO activation can't reproduce a double-click timing window or Cmd/Shift-click. The grid tile's double-click-open + the tag chip's Cmd-click-add were both VO-unreachable until each got an `.accessibilityAction` routing through the same call the mouse makes. Branch by node kind where the mouse path does (tile open = `selectedFile` for a file but `openSubfolder` for a `.folder`). The right-click `contextMenu` is VO-reachable; a bare gesture is not.

### Session index

The full chronological narrative of every working session (2026-06-12 → present),
branch by branch, lives in **`docs/session-log.md`** — read the relevant dated entry
when you need the full "why" behind a specific change. The load-bearing, must-not-break
rules distilled from those sessions are captured in **Durable constraints & gotchas**
above; the **Architecture map** below is the current-state file index.

## Architecture map

The full file-by-file index lives in **`docs/architecture-map.md`** — read it when
locating where something lives. High-level layout of `Muse/Muse/`:

- **`MuseApp.swift` / `ContentView.swift`** — app entry + NavigationSplitView shell (toolbar, sidebar, grid).
- **`Models/`** — `AppState` (@MainActor singleton; state core + `AppState+*` method extensions), plus the pure value types that drive the UI (`AssetKind`, `FileNode`, `Mood`, `ImageLayout`, `TileBackground`, `GridFilter`, sort modes).
- **`Filesystem/`** — roots/bookmarks, folder tree + reader, FSEvents watcher, folder stats, path reconcile, thumbnails, iCloud sidecars.
- **`Database/`** — GRDB queue + migrations, records, FTS5 + tag search, tag scoping/store, housekeeping.
- **`Localization/`** + `Localizable.xcstrings` — display-time localization (storage stays canonical-English).
- **`Indexing/`** — SHA-256 hashing + the identity-reconciling `Indexer`.
- **`Intelligence/`** — Vision (classify/OCR/color), smart sort, dedup, palette/intent, collections engine, the automatic `AnalyzePipeline`.
- **`Viewers/`** — per-kind viewers + the hero image/video viewers (`HeroPalette`, `FileMetadata`, `Viewer/`).
- **`Views/`** — grid, sidebar (+ `Sidebar/`), collections page, tag chips, popovers, sheets, duplicates, backup wizard.
- **`Components/`** — pure UI math (selection, page-scroll, reorder, escape resolver, masonry geometry) — all unit-tested.
- **`Backup/`** + **`Export/`** — library backup/restore (by content hash) + collection PDF export.
- **`Effects/` / `Settings/` / `Agents/AppIntents/`** — delete fade modifier; settings store + modal; Shortcuts/Siri intents.
- **`Muse.entitlements` / `Muse-Debug.entitlements`** — sandbox + iCloud + Sparkle network; Debug drops iCloud keys.
- **`MuseShareExtension/`** — the "Send to Muse" Finder share extension (separate target).

## Conventions

- **Keep docs lean.** This file is loaded every session — record the durable rule + why in one or two lines, not the full narrative. Per-session detail goes in `docs/session-log.md`; the file index is `docs/architecture-map.md`. Prune as you go; don't let it bloat back up.
- **GRDB writes are async** — use `try await queue.write { ... }` and
  `try await queue.read { ... }`. The synchronous overload exists but
  conflicts with the async one inside async contexts; pick one and the
  build will tell you fast.
- **GRDB rows are inserted as `var`** — `MutablePersistableRecord.insert`
  mutates `id` in place. `let` rows fail to compile.
- **Manual tags beat vision tags** on label conflict (Q32). Enforced
  via `UNIQUE(file_id, parent_dir, label)` + branching in
  `Indexer.unionTags` and `AnalyzePipeline.analyzeOne`. This is what makes
  automatic re-analysis safe — it can never undo a user's tag edit.
- **Tags are per-file-LOCATION, not per content hash** (2026-06-17). A tag
  belongs to `(file_id, parent_dir)` — the same content in another folder
  is a different image with its own tags; deletes never leak across
  folders. Derive the folder key via `TagScope`. There is NO library-wide
  tag delete. Content-derived metadata (palette/caption/dims/intent) stays
  content-keyed by design (identical for identical pixels; auto-splits on
  edit). See the 2026-06-17 per-file-tags session log.
- **Analysis is automatic + incremental** — it runs after indexing for
  files whose `analyzed_hash` ≠ `content_hash` (new/changed only); never
  re-processes unchanged files. **Auto-tagging and auto-collections are
  opt-out** in Preferences (⌘, → `AppSettings`, both default ON): off → newly
  added folders stay viewable but aren't auto-processed, while existing data is
  untouched and the manual paths still work (menu-bar Regenerate Tags;
  hand-made collections via the Collections-page **+**). There's no prominent
  "Analyze" toolbar button — the automatic pass is the front door.
- **Files are never deleted, only moved to Trash** via
  `NSWorkspace.shared.recycle`. Don't `unlink` user files. Ever.
- **No editing UI** — every "edit this" path goes through Open With…
  (`NSWorkspace.shared.open(url, withApplicationAt: ...)`).
- **No network calls — with exactly ONE sanctioned exception.** If you reach
  for `URLSession`, stop, UNLESS you're in the **Google Drive share** code
  (`Sharing/Drive/`), the only feature allowed network egress (besides
  Sparkle), and only inside an explicit user action (sign-in / Publish /
  Manage / the expiry sweep). Everywhere else the rule holds: the Markdown
  viewer has no web stack, and the SVG viewer hard-blocks remote loads via a
  `WKContentRuleList` (resource-layer — the nav delegate alone misses
  subresources; see the durable-constraints note); new third-party deps must be
  audited for network surface. Drive uses `drive.file` (least privilege),
  PKCE (no client secret), Keychain-only device-only tokens, and the page
  carries its manifest in the URL fragment (no secrets, no API key).
- **AppState is @MainActor**. So is most of the data layer. Background
  work (hashing, Vision) goes through `Task.detached(priority:)` or
  the `Indexer` actor's queues.
- **SourceKit module errors are noise.** During edits you'll see
  "Cannot find type 'FileNode' in scope" and similar — they're cross-
  file resolution issues that disappear at build time. Always verify
  with `xcodebuild ... build` before assuming something's broken.
- **The app is LOCALIZED — every new user-facing string MUST be localized.**
  Muse ships French (`feat/localization-french`, 346 UI strings in
  `Localizable.xcstrings` + 1303 Vision tag terms in
  `Localization/VisionVocabulary.json`); the infra is language-agnostic. As long
  as more than one language exists, **any new feature/UI text is incomplete until
  it's localized** — treat it like a test you must keep green. Rules:
  - **Storage stays canonical-English; localize at DISPLAY time.** Never persist a
    translated string (DB/FTS/collection rows/tags). AI tag labels render via
    `VocabularyLocalizer.shared.display(label)`; the stored label is the canonical
    English key (also the search/dedup identity). A new Vision-derived label that
    should localize needs a row in `VisionVocabulary.json`.
  - **Compiler extraction ONLY sees SwiftUI text-literal positions** —
    `Text("…")`, `Button("…")`, `Label`, `.help("…")`, `.accessibilityLabel("…")`,
    `Section`, `.navigationTitle`, `.alert` titles, `Toggle`/`Picker` titles. Those
    auto-localize and `xcodebuild -exportLocalizations` extracts them.
  - **Anything passed as a `String` is NOT extracted and will ship in English** —
    AppKit setters (`NSSearchField.placeholderString`, `NS*Panel.prompt/.message`,
    `NSMenuItem(title:)`), custom-view `title:`/`label:`/`text:`/`caption:`/
    `placeholder:` params, `ternary ? "a" : "b"`, string concatenation,
    `enum.displayName`/`label` properties, and method return values. **Hand-wrap
    each in `String(localized:)`** (it auto-extracts once wrapped). For a label
    built from a RUNTIME variable (e.g. `Text(row.label)` where `label` is dynamic),
    use `NSLocalizedString(var, comment:)` and add the keys to the catalog manually.
    This applies to VoiceOver too: `.accessibilityLabel/Hint/Value` built dynamically
    are read aloud and must be wrapped.
  - **Workflow for new strings / a new language:** wrap literals → run
    `xcodebuild -exportLocalizations -project Muse/Muse.xcodeproj -localizationPath
    <dir> -exportLanguage <lang>` (it write-backs every key into the source
    `.xcstrings` — a plain build does NOT) → fill the empty `<lang>` values → it
    reports 0 untranslated when done. Add the language to `knownRegions`.
  - **Longer localized text overflows fixed-width controls** — budget ~1.3× the
    English width; use `lineLimit(1)` + `.truncationMode(.tail)` +
    `.minimumScaleFactor(…)` (or a wider frame).
  - **Don't prune `NSLocalizedString(variable)`-reached keys as orphans.** The
    extractor can't see runtime-variable keys, so `-exportLocalizations` marks them
    `extractionState: stale` even though they're used and DO compile to `fr.lproj`
    (the 14 INFO-card metadata labels — `Taken`/`Camera`/… — are the standing case).
    A genuinely orphaned key is one no longer referenced in code at all; verify before
    deleting.
  - **A concatenation only localizes the wrapped part** — `String(localized: "A ") + "B"`
    ships "B" in English (and a remaining-English grep for `String(localized:` won't
    flag it). Wrap the WHOLE phrase as one key. Same trap: a ternary/`??` whose other
    branch has interpolation forces the `String` overload, so literal branches need
    explicit `String(localized:)`.
  - **Run the unit suite in an English host.** Enum-`displayName`/toast tests assert
    the English source; a per-app French override (`defaults write com.tarrats.Muse
    AppleLanguages '("fr")'`) makes them read French and fail — that's expected, not
    a regression. To preview the app in French, launch with
    `open -n <Muse.app> --args -AppleLanguages "(fr)"` (a one-shot arg, no defaults
    write, so it doesn't pollute later test runs).
  - See the `feat/localization-french` session log for the full design (display-time
    layer, `VocabularyLocalizer` seam, search bridge, three removal kill-switches).

## Open product questions (none currently)

All Q1–Q33 from the plan are locked in, with two superseded by the
2026-06-12 session:

- **Q10 (analysis manual-only)** — superseded. Analysis now runs
  automatically after indexing, incrementally (stale `analyzed_hash`).
- **Q9 / Phase 7 (chat panel)** — retired. The differentiating version
  is tool-calling; the v1 context-prompted panel was removed. History
  holds it for when that phase happens.

Future product decisions should be recorded in
`docs/superpowers/plans/file-viewer-rewrite.md` (or a sibling plan doc)
before implementation.

## How to run

1. Open `Muse/Muse.xcodeproj` in Xcode 16+.
2. Build & run (Cmd+R). The app starts on a clean shell — click
   "Add Folder" in the sidebar to point Muse at any folder on disk.
3. Toolbar (left → right): sidebar toggle · sort · sort-direction arrow
   (flips the active mode's order — newest↔oldest, A↔Z, …) · filter
   (line.3.horizontal.decrease.circle — funnel popover: kind/date/size facets,
   engaged-blue when active, stays live during search) · show-subfolders ·
   search (center) · Collections (square.stack.3d.up) · Image Layout
   (square.grid.2x2) · background mood (paintpalette — popover also holds the
   Tile Background picker) ·
   ⓘ About. (The grid/cloud/galaxy view picker and the water effect were
   removed 2026-06-13; the clear-collection ✕ was removed in favor of back
   arrows.) Find Duplicates lives in the File menu; Pin/Unpin Folder and
   Remove Folder live in the Edit menu; analysis runs automatically.
4. Sandboxed container path:
   `~/Library/Containers/com.tarrats.Muse/Data/Library/Application Support/Muse/`.
   `muse.sqlite` there; wipe it to rebuild the schema on next launch.
5. ThumbnailCache lives beside it; capped at 2GB, LRU-evicted on launch.

## Status as of merge to main

- Branch state: `main` is now at the merged tip; `dev` is preserved at
  the pre-rewrite water-toggle commit (older); `feat/file-viewer-rewrite`
  is the source-of-truth branch for the rewrite progression.
- Test coverage: a real unit-test suite exists (`MuseTests`, ~36 files) —
  pure logic, schema migrations, and store/model behaviors (e.g. tag scoping +
  the `v7` migration, collection identity/membership, manual-collection naming,
  sort/selection/page-scroll math, palette/color/intent). UI views aren't
  unit-tested. Run with `xcodebuild -scheme Muse test`; keep it green.
- Current by-design behaviors (NOT bugs, NOT pending work — documented so a
  future session doesn't mistake them for defects):
  - iCloud Drive: dataless (not-yet-downloaded) files are skipped on
    index/hash until macOS downloads them (avoids empty-hash corruption).
  - iCloud sidecar hydration — two inherent behaviors: (1) **OCR full-text
    search is degraded on hydrate-only devices.** Sidecars don't carry OCR text
    (large; intentionally excluded), so a device that only hydrated a file
    (never ran Vision locally) matches FTS on basename + caption only, not OCR'd
    text. The file is marked analyzed, so it won't re-Vision to recover OCR.
    Intent IS carried, so intent collections are unaffected. (2) **Byte-identical
    content split across subfolders.** Sidecars live in a per-folder `.muse/`
    keyed by content hash; identical files in different subfolders of the iCloud
    zone only get a sidecar beside the copy that was analyzed, so the other copy
    won't hydrate on a fresh device until its own analyze pass runs.

## Working with this codebase

- Use the rewrite plan as the source of truth for "why does it work
  this way" questions.
- When in doubt about a product decision, the plan's locked Q-number
  table answers most of them.
- Keep commits scoped to a single phase or feature; the rewrite log
  is a useful reference and merging clean diffs preserves it.
